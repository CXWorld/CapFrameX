# CapFrameX.OSD prebuilt binaries

Fallback binaries for the hook-free OSD, built from the private
[CXWorld/CapFrameX.OSD](https://github.com/CXWorld/CapFrameX.OSD) repository.

The build uses these automatically when the `external/CapFrameX.OSD` submodule is not
checked out (developers without access to the private repo). With the submodule present,
the OSD is built from source instead and these files are ignored.

## Contents

- `net9.0-windows/` — `CapFrameX.OSD.Interop.dll` (managed P/Invoke bridge, x64)
- `native/cfx_osd_core.dll` — native renderer (x64, RelWithDebInfo)
- `native/cfx_osd_hook.dll` — x64 DXGI hook
- `native/x86/` — x86 DXGI hook. The hook DLL alone: `HookInjector` resolves the target's 32-bit
  `LoadLibraryW` from the x64 app, so no separate 32-bit injector is shipped
- `native/vk/` — x64 Vulkan implicit layer + versioned loader manifest
- `native/vk/x86/` — the same pair for 32-bit Vulkan games

Both manifests are byte-identical; only their folder decides which DLL the loader picks up,
because `library_path` inside them is relative. Keep each DLL next to its manifest.

The WiX installer registers each manifest in its **own** registry view under
`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Khronos\Vulkan\ImplicitLayers` — the x64 one in the 64-bit view, the x86 one in
WOW6432Node. That split is load-bearing, not cosmetic: the Vulkan loader identifies a layer by
the name inside the manifest, so a manifest reachable by processes that cannot load its DLL
shadows the correct registration and disables the layer for that bitness. Portable builds stage
the files but do not change the registry.

## Updating (requires access to the private repo)

```
cd CapFrameX.OSD                      # the OSD repo
cmake --preset vs2022 && cmake --build build --config RelWithDebInfo   # in CapFrameX.OSD/CapFrameX.OSD
dotnet build CapFrameX.OSD.sln -c Release
cd CapFrameX.OSD/vk_layer             # the 32-bit Vulkan layer is a separate build tree
cmake -B build-x86 -A Win32 && cmake --build build-x86 --config RelWithDebInfo
```

Then copy the managed bridge, core, x64/x86 hooks, and both Vulkan layers/manifests from their
`RelWithDebInfo` outputs into the matching folders above, and bump the submodule to the matching
commit. The Vulkan manifest is renamed on the way in: the build emits `cfx_osd_vklayer.json`,
this tree keeps the versioned `cfx_osd_vklayer_v1.json`.

Configure every native tree with the **same** toolset the core preset pins (`-G "Visual Studio 17
2022"`). `hook_poc` and `vk_layer` take no preset, so omitting `-G` silently picks the newest
installed Visual Studio and produces hook and layer DLLs built against a different toolset than
the core — all three end up loaded in the same game process.
