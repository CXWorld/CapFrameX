# CapFrameX.OSD prebuilt binaries

Fallback binaries for the hook-free OSD, built from the private
[CXWorld/CapFrameX.OSD](https://github.com/CXWorld/CapFrameX.OSD) repository.

The build uses these automatically when the `external/CapFrameX.OSD` submodule is not
checked out (developers without access to the private repo). With the submodule present,
the OSD is built from source instead and these files are ignored.

## Contents

- `net9.0-windows/` — `CapFrameX.OSD.Interop.dll` (managed P/Invoke bridge, x64)
- `native/cfx_osd_core.dll` — native renderer (x64, RelWithDebInfo)
- `native/cfx_osd_hook.dll` — x64 DXGI hook, including exact swapchain capture through
  Streamline's factory methods, FidelityFX frame-generation creation APIs, and XeSS-FG's public
  `GetSwapChainPtr` API, with RTTI fallback. Before FidelityFX replaces a swapchain, the hook
  releases every overlay reference to its backbuffers so the old chain can be destroyed cleanly.
  Proxy rendering is bound to the application queue supplied during initialization and rejects
  queues whose D3D12 device does not own the swapchain. The generic D3D12 route retires resources
  when its observed queue changes and waits for a bounded, buffer-count-sized run of subsequent
  Presents before rebuilding and submitting on the replacement queue. It retains FidelityFX
  creation/destruction hooks as swapchain-lifecycle boundaries even while other vendor presentation
  and status hooks are disabled, unless a compatibility profile explicitly keeps the generic native
  route authoritative across FidelityFX transitions. Such a profile can instead arm generic DXGI
  factory lifecycle hooks: they wait for submitted overlay work and release all old backbuffer
  references before `CreateSwapChain*` replaces the chain, while holding the Present lifecycle
  lock across the original DXGI call. Once a captured FidelityFX replacement
  swapchain exists, its proxy Present and API-provided queue are exclusive; independently driven
  native output Presents are suppressed. Frame-generation telemetry is a separately compiled
  provider-control component with no DXGI, D3D, queue, or renderer dependency. It observes
  Streamline DLSS-FG, FidelityFX FSR-FG, and XeSS-FG through their explicit control/status APIs;
  Streamline late attach resolves the two documented DLSS-FG entry points and removes those hooks
  at the documented feature-unload boundary. Compatibility profiles can therefore disable every
  vendor factory, Present, Resize, or swapchain-lifecycle hook without suppressing telemetry.
- `native/x86/` — x86 DXGI hook. The hook DLL alone: `HookInjector` resolves the target's 32-bit
  `LoadLibraryW` from the x64 app, so no separate 32-bit injector is shipped
- `native/MinHook.LICENSE.txt` — BSD license for MinHook, statically linked into both DXGI hooks
- `native/vk/` — x64 Vulkan implicit layer + versioned loader manifest
- `native/vk/x86/` — the same pair for 32-bit Vulkan games

Both manifests are byte-identical; only their folder decides which DLL the loader picks up,
because `library_path` inside them is relative. Keep each DLL next to its manifest.

The WiX installer registers each manifest in its **own** registry view under
`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Khronos\Vulkan\ImplicitLayers` — the x64 one in the 64-bit view, the x86 one in
WOW6432Node. That split is load-bearing, not cosmetic: the Vulkan loader identifies a layer by
the name inside the manifest, so a manifest reachable by processes that cannot load its DLL
shadows the correct registration and disables the layer for that bitness. Portable builds stage
the files but do not change the registry.

## Updating (requires access to the private repo)

```
cd CapFrameX.OSD                      # the OSD repo
cmake --preset vs2026 && cmake --build build --config RelWithDebInfo   # in CapFrameX.OSD/CapFrameX.OSD
dotnet build CapFrameX.OSD.sln -c Release
cd CapFrameX.OSD/vk_layer             # the 32-bit Vulkan layer is a separate build tree
cmake -B build-x86 -G "Visual Studio 18 2026" -A Win32 && cmake --build build-x86 --config RelWithDebInfo
```

Then copy the managed bridge, core, x64/x86 hooks, and both Vulkan layers/manifests from their
`RelWithDebInfo` outputs into the matching folders above, and bump the submodule to the matching
commit. The Vulkan manifest is renamed on the way in: the build emits `cfx_osd_vklayer.json`,
this tree keeps the versioned `cfx_osd_vklayer_v1.json`.

Configure every native tree with the **same** toolset the core preset pins (`-G "Visual Studio 18
2026"`, toolset v145, matching the `.vcxproj` projects in this repo). `hook_poc` and `vk_layer`
take no preset, so passing `-G` explicitly is what keeps them in step: core, hook and layer all end
up loaded in the same game process, and a silent toolset split between them is hard to spot.

Rebuild **all** native trees, not just the core: `hook_poc` and `vk_layer` compile the core sources
into themselves (`${CFX_OSD_CORE_SRC}`), so a core change that is not followed by a rebuild of
those two leaves them silently behind.
